# Time Animation Report

This is a breakdown of the data gathered from my animation work on a full 7-minute music video to celebrate the 50th anniversary release of Pink Floyd's 1973 album, "The Dark Side of the Moon". Hours of work were tracked every day, separated into specific fields outlining each individual section of the song.

## Goals

- Learn more Python and demonstrate sorting/visualization techniques that further develop an understanding of the libraries used, specifically: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy.
- Find which day of the weekday I had the highest average amount of hours worked.
- See overall trends in effort based on external factors (classes/vacations) throughout the year.
- Finish with a pie chart to show the percentages of how much time was spent on each particular section of the song.
