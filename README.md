# Time Animation Report

This is a breakdown of the data gathered from my animation work on a full 7-minute music video to celebrate the 50th anniversary release of Pink Floyd's 1973 album, "The Dark Side of the Moon". Hours of work were tracked every day, separated into specific fields outlining each individual section of the song.

## Goals

- Learn more Python and demonstrate sorting/visualization techniques that further develop an understanding of the libraries used, specifically: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy.
- Find which day of the weekday I had the highest average amount of hours worked.
- See overall trends in effort based on external factors (classes/vacations) throughout the year.
- Finish with a pie chart to show the percentages of how much time was spent on each particular section of the song.
- Describe the process of each of these data points, analyze any interesting traits about the data.

## Outcomes  

Once I finished up this report, I felt a much stronger understanding with smaller nuances involved in the process of extracting the intended data points as well as customizing visualizations. I hadn't really done much of a deep dive in fine-tuning details in the plots, such as placing text inside the bars of a horizontal bar chart, or outlining sections along a line plot to indicate specific traits that might be affecting a trend, etc. I do feel that I was able to do these things effectively, and it was made all the more easier by the fact that the data was clean since I knew exactly what needed to be track every day.

Furthermore, this report was also a fun little project to supplement a very large, ambitious animation project from 2023. I was deeply invested in finishing the piece before the end of the year, so to be able to bring a love of animation together with a newfound passion for data science/programming was a really cool experience!
